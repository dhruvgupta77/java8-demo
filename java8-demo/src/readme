The difference between map() and flatMap() in Java 8.

You should use a map() if you just want to transform one Stream into another where each element gets converted
to one single value. Use flatMap() if the function used by map operation returns multiple values and you want
just one list containing all values.

In short, here are the key difference between map() vs flatMap() in Java 8:
The function you pass to map() operation returns a single value.
The function you pass to flatMap() operation returns a Stream of value.
flatMap() is a combination of map and flat operation.
map() is used for transformation only, but flatMap() is used for both transformation and flattening.
